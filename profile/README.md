## Background

Tourism is one of the world's fastest-growing industries, significantly contributing to a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and job creation. Ranking third among major global tourism markets, Southeast Asia expects around 125.78 million annual visitors. Tourism contributes 12% of the regionâ€™s GDP and 4% of employment, deeply impacting local economies.

However, the influx of tourists brings challenges, particularly when tourists lack awareness of local customs and etiquette, leading to actions that can be perceived as disrespectful. For instance, on March 22, 2023, when two foreign nationals from Poland camped at Balai Bengong in Bali during Nyepi Day, a sacred day of silence. This incident highlights the importance of cultural awareness in maintaining positive relations between tourists and locals. Additionally, many tourists arrive unprepared for weather conditions, often choosing inappropriate clothing for the climate, which detracts from their overall comfort.

Given these challenges, the demand for intelligent and flexible travel tools is essential. A smart travel assistant can build a solid understanding of cultural insights, so tourists can navigate social situations more confidently and avoid making cultural mistakes. Having this awareness will ensure a smoother and more respectful experience when engaging with a different culture.

We planned on implementing NLP for delivering personalized travel assistance through a chatbot, suggesting preparation tips based on weather forecasts for selected dates. Additionally, it provides cultural insights of the destination that will help users adapt to local customs and enjoy a well-prepared vacation. To then deploy it to google cloud using cloud run, which our mobile development team can use to make the application.

The final product that we have developed implemented all the features that we wanted, which gives users the necessary information about the cultures and weather of their desired destination, so that they would know what to do and what to prepare when journeying into a foreign place.
